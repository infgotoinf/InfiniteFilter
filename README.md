## The Pitch
Infinite Filter is a free open source application for filtering images, made for those who want to learn more about image filters and create their own, as app allows you to write them with C++ code.

Infinite Filter is designed to be fast and simple, but also have it's own style. It is created as a collage project to be my first real application.
